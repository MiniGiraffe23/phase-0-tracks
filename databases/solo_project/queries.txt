Run a SQL query for each of the following:

1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

	sqlite> SELECT * FROM actors;
	1|Eric|Bana|true|1
	2|Josh|Hartnett|true|1
	3|Ewan|McGregor|true|1
	4|Viggo|Mortensen|true|2
	5|Christopher|Lee|false|2
	6|Elijah|Wood|true|2

2. Update an item that meets some condition.

	UPDATE actors SET still_alive="true" WHERE first_name="Christopher";

	 SELECT * FROM actors WHERE first_name="Christopher";
	 5|Christopher|Lee|true|2

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

	 SELECT * FROM actors, movies WHERE actors.movie_id = movies.id;

	1|Eric|Bana|true|1|1|Black Hawk Down|2001|7.7
	2|Josh|Hartnett|true|1|1|Black Hawk Down|2001|7.7
	3|Ewan|McGregor|true|1|1|Black Hawk Down|2001|7.7
	4|Viggo|Mortensen|true|2|2|The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring|2001|8.8
	5|Christopher|Lee|true|2|2|The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring|2001|8.8
	6|Elijah|Wood|true|2|2|The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring|2001|8.8

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

	DELETE FROM movies WHERE viewer_rating<8;

	SELECT * FROM movies;
	2|The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring|2001|8.8

RELEASE 3: Research -

Four types of joins: inner, left, right and full.
Inner selects all records from Table A and B where a particular condition is met.

Left join selects all data from Table A along with data from Table B in which a particular condition is met.

Right join selects all data from Table B along with data from Table A where a particular condition is met.

Full join selest all frecords from Table A and B regardless of whether a particular condition is met. 

INNER JOIN:

	SELECT actors.first_name, movies.title FROM actors JOIN movies ON actors.movie_id = movies.id;

	Viggo|The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring
	Christopher|The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring
	Elijah|The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring

LEFT JOIN:

	SELECT actors.first_name, actors.last_name, movies.title FROM actors LEFT JOIN movies on actors.movie_id=movies.id ORDER BY actors.last_name;

(some columns blank due to earlier deletion)
