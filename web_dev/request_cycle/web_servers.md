4. Portability over efficiency
5. Data stored in flat text files

A virtual private server is installed on a computer serving multiple websites. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system . They are much easier to create and configure and have a lower price. 


Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

1. Mistakes could actually mess up your system's ability to operate.
2. Security vulnerabilities will allow any failure access to your entire system.
3. Lack of accountability, if everyone is using the root account than it's hard to find out who did what.
